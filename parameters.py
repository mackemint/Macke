# Offsetting compensation. Yeah.

# Used to turn code block on/off
# Also triggers volume control in the script. Need Matrix for Volume

### NAVIGATION of Control Surface Box ###
### Box navigation. Operates as pairs up/down and left/right

# Up / Down
up_button_note_number = 7 # up navigation
down_button_note_number = 8 # down navigation
# Left / Right
left_button_note_number = 9 # left navigation
right_button_note_number = 10 # right navigation

### CONTROL SURFACE SIZE

## Declare the size of the box in Ableton clip cells.
# This is used to check the launch button count where box_width x box_height = count(launch_button_list)
# used for volume 
box_width = 6 # width of the the "red-box" aka tracks
box_height = 6 #height of the "red-box" aka scenes

### Launch button list *** Required *** Python list format
# Assigned Left to Right, Top to bottom, comma separated

    54,55,56,57,58,59]
# the number of notes in launch_button_list must match box_width * box_height

# Assigned left to right. Use empty list do disable example below.
stop_track_buttons = [] # Uncomment this line to use no track stop buttons and add comment to next line
# Track stop code block is enabled if variable is not empty via a count
#stop_track_buttons = [10,11,12,13]
### (if used) stop_track_buttons must match box_width

### (if used) scene_launch_notes launch notes must match box_height

### Stop all clips. Disabled by the use of Python None assignment. Example below.
#  stop_all_clips = None # Uncomment this line to use no stop all clips button and add comment to next line
# Stop all clips code block is enabled if variable is set to a valid numeric MIDI value
stop_all_clips = None
